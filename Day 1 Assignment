1.What is your understanding of blockchain?

Blockchain is a ledger, Which is encrypted and saved in distributed database.This give security, immutability, verifiability.

2.What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?

*Authenticity 
*The dependence of a centralized head or a third party
*Security

3.What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?

*Verifiable
*Unchangeable
*Tamper-proof
*Immutable
*Internet 2.0

4.What all things does a Block contain?

*Block Number 
*Data to be stored
*Previous Block key
*Mining key

5.How the verifiability of Blockchain has been attained?

*In blockchain the data is stored in a distributed database in form of blocks.And every block will generated a unique code for the data.
*This block with unique code will be stored. And will check whether all the code in every block in every system is same.
*If Any change happens then the code generated will be different.The mismatch in the code of this system with every other system will alert that something is changed.
*By this way blockchain implements verifiability.
